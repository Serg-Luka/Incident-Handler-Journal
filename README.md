# Incident-Handler-Journal
In this project, I simulate the process of reviewing a security incident and documenting it in my incident handler's journal, which is one of the most crucial documents in handling an incident.

### Skills Gained

- **Incident Documentation:** Gained hands-on experience in recording a cybersecurity incident in detail, ensuring that every aspect is properly documented.
- **Incident Analysis:** Developed skills in reviewing the sequence of events to understand how the attackers operated.
- **Communication:** Enhanced my ability to share incident details and responses clearly with various stakeholders.
- **Response Planning:** Developed a methodical approach to planning responses to cybersecurity incidents.
- **Ethical and Legal Considerations:** Became aware of the legal and ethical implications that may arise when responding to a cyberattack, such as the decision of whether to pay a ransom during a ransomware attack.

### Tools Used

## Scenario 1 - Ransomware Attack
_A small healthcare clinic in the United States, specialising in primary care, experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning at around 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported they could not access their computers or important files such as medical records. This caused a complete halt in business operations as staff couldn’t access the software or files necessary for their work._

_Additionally, the employees found a ransom note on their computers, stating that all the company’s files had been encrypted by a group of malicious hackers known for targeting healthcare and transportation industries. The ransom note demanded a substantial sum of money for a decryption key to restore access to the encrypted files._

_The attackers gained access to the clinic’s network through targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees. These emails contained a malicious attachment that, when downloaded, installed malware on the employee’s system._

_Upon gaining access, the attackers deployed ransomware to encrypt crucial files. This prevented the clinic from accessing important patient data, causing significant disruption to their business operations. As a result, the company shut down its systems and contacted relevant organisations for technical support._

| **Who:**                                      | A group of organised cybercriminals      |
| **What:**                                     | A ransomware attack                      |
| **Where:**                                    | At a healthcare clinic                   |
| **When:**                                     | Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.             |
| **Why:**                                      | The incident occurred because the attackers were able to access the company’s network via phishing emails. Once inside, they deployed ransomware that encrypted essential files. The motive behind the attack appears to be financial, as the ransom note demanded a large sum of money for the decryption key.  |


| **Additional Notes**                          |                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **How the Incident Unfolded:**                | Around 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday, employees found they could not access files. They discovered a ransom note informing them that their files had been encrypted. The attackers infiltrated the network through targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments. Once inside, they deployed ransomware to encrypt critical files, severely disrupting business operations and patient care. |
| **Immediate Actions Taken:**                  | The clinic shut down its systems to prevent further damage and contacted cybersecurity specialists for help. The incident was also reported to relevant authorities. |
| **Impact on Business Operations:**            | The clinic was unable to access crucial patient data, leading to a halt in operations, which affected patient care and caused significant disruption. |
| **Communication with Stakeholders:**          | The clinic kept employees, patients, and partners informed about the incident and the measures being taken to resolve it. |
| **Investigation Findings:**                   | Initial investigations confirmed that the phishing emails were the entry point. It appears the attackers had carefully researched the organisation to craft emails that would be convincing to specific employees. |

| **Recommendations**   |                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Employee Training:**                        | Regular cybersecurity training should be provided to employees to raise awareness of phishing and how to spot such attacks. |
| **Email Security:**                           | Advanced email filtering solutions should be implemented to detect and block malicious emails. |
| **Endpoint Protection:**                      | Ensure robust endpoint protection software is in place to detect and prevent malware execution. |
| **Backup and Recovery:**                      | Ensure regular backups of critical data are made and stored securely offline. Test backup restoration procedures to ensure reliability. |
| **Incident Response Plan:**                   | Develop a comprehensive and regularly updated incident response plan to handle ransomware attacks and other threats. |
| **Access Controls:**                          | Enforce strict access controls and monitor network traffic to detect and prevent unauthorised access. |
| **Patching and Updates:**                     | Ensure that all systems and software are regularly updated with the latest security patches. |

| **Considerations regarding the Ransomware Attack**   |                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Risk of Non-Retrieval:**                    | Paying the ransom doesn’t guarantee the attackers will provide the decryption key. |
| **Funding Criminal Activities:**              | Paying the ransom may encourage further criminal activities and fund illicit operations. |
| **Legal and Ethical Implications:**           | There are legal and ethical implications regarding paying ransoms. Legal counsel should be consulted before any decision is made. |
| **Alternative Solutions:**                    | The focus should be on restoring systems from backups and engaging cybersecurity experts to decrypt files without paying the ransom. |

## Conclusion

This incident underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures, such as employee training, effective email security, and a solid incident response plan. The company must invest in preventive measures to reduce the risk of future attacks and ensure continuity in the face of similar events. Paying the ransom is not recommended due to the uncertainties and potential negative outcomes. Instead, the company should focus on improving its overall cybersecurity posture and recovery strategies.
